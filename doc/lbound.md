# LBOUND

## Syntax

```
LBound(<array variable>)
LBound(<array variable>, <dimension>)
```


## Description

Returns the array lower bound of the given <dimension>. If the <dimension> is not specified, it defaults to 0.
If the specified <dimension> is 0, then total number of dimensions is returned.

## Examples

```
DIM a(3 TO 5, 1 TO 8)
PRINT LBound(a, 2) : REM Prints 1
PRINT Lbound(a) : REM Prints 2, the number of dimensions
```

The result is always a 16bit integer value.


If `<dimension>` is 0 the number of dimensions in the array is returned
(use it to guess the number of dimensions of an array):

```
DIM a(3 TO 5, 2 TO 8)
PRINT LBound(a, 0): REM Prints 2, since 'a' has 2 dimensions
```


## Remarks

* This function does not exists in Sinclair BASIC.
