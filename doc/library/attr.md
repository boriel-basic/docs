## Requirements

ATTR is a library function to be included with the following command:

```
# include <attr.bas>
```

## Description
`ATTR(row, col)`

Returns the ATTR (color attribute) of the given screen coordinate at the given row and column.


## Sample usage

```
# include <attr.bas>

PRINT AT 9, 10;PAPER 4; "A"
LET s = ATTR$(9, 10)
PRINT AT 0, 0; "The attribute of screen position 9, 10 is "; s
```

## Remarks

* This function extends the one in Sinclair BASIC (and it's compatible with it) since it also allows rows 22 and 23.
